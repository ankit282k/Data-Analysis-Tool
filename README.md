A Complete Solution for all the Data Analysis need using OPENAI API and Pandas AI.

## üêº PandasAI
PandasAI is a Python library that adds Generative AI capabilities to pandas, the popular data analysis and manipulation tool. It is designed to be used in conjunction with pandas, and is not a replacement for it.

PandasAI makes pandas (and all the most used data analyst libraries) conversational, allowing you to ask questions to your data in natural language. For example, you can ask PandasAI to find all the rows in a DataFrame where the value of a column is greater than 5, and it will return a DataFrame containing only those rows.

## OPEN AI
The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that requires understanding or generating natural language and code. The OpenAI API can also be used to generate and edit images or convert speech into text. We offer a range of models with different capabilities and price points, as well as the ability to fine-tune custom models.
OpenAI's GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) models have been trained to understand natural language and code. GPTs provide text outputs in response to their inputs. The inputs to GPTs are also referred to as "prompts". Designing a prompt is essentially how you "program" a GPT model, usually by providing instructions or some examples of how to successfully complete a task. GPTs can be used across a great variety of tasks including content or code generation, summarization, conversation, creative writing, and more.
